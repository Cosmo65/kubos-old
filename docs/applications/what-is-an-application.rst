What is a Mission Applications?
==============================

Mission Applications include anything that make decisions or governs autonomy on the satellite, as well an any other applications designed to address mission-specific concerns. These are, by nature, unique to each mission, but some of them can be largely reused due to the abstract nature of the hardware integration. 

Autonomy Applications
---------------------

Applications can be used to enable the satellite to act autonomously. Some basic versions of this are:

- Querying Hardware Services and storing telemetry
- Creating and broadcasting telemetry beacons that change depending on satellite state
- Controlling deployment procedures

Much more advanced versions can be employed as well. Many of these basic cases can be mostly reused mission to mission, but will require some modification depending on hardware configuration. 

Mission Operation Applications
------------------------------

Applications are also used to accomplish specific mission goals. Some possible exampes are:

- Image analysis 
- Payload operation 
- Payload monitoring

Really, applications can be used to accomplish anything on the system, and are only limited by the computational or hardware capabilities of the spacecraft.
